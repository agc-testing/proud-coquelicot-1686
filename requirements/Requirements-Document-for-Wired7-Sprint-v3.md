# Retro sleek landing page with rocket launch site

### Description
The landing page for our application should feature Elon's first passenger-carrying rocket to mars, ready to take-off, in a retro sleek style.

### Design Requirements

- Since the web application should be interactive, we'll want to make sure the assets for the scene are sliced such that they can move if needed; we don't want a single static background for the application.
- Assets should be in a retro-sleek style, and should include a rocket, passengers boarding, and scenery

### Development Requirements

- Let's go with Ember.js as the frontend framework
- The landing page should display as the index route
